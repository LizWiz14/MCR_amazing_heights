## Amazing Heights
Is a datapack that changes the Minecraft build restriction in the overworld to 0-512.
It is intended to be used alongside the [Mirabilis Terra World Generator pack](https://github.com/LizWiz14/MCR_amazing_overworld).

### Installation
Installation is not really straight forward, as Microsoft, in all their wisdom, decided 
that you can only add datapacks to servers, *after* the world generation, which is bad 
when the world generation depends on the datapack. You can either create a singleplayer
world and add this datapack, alongside some version of the [Terra World Generator](https://modrinth.com/plugin/terra) with 
the [Mirabilis pack](https://github.com/LizWiz14/MCR_amazing_overworld) selected, or apparently you can start a server, insert the datapack, 
reload the datapacks and kill the server (so it doesn't save the wrongly generated world)
and of course have the aforementioned Plugin/Mod whatever with the correct pack installed.
